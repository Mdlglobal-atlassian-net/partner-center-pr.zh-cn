# <a name="create-a-marketing-profile"></a>Create a marketing profile

**Applies to**

-  Partner Center

As a qualified Microsoft partner, you can create a marketing profile to showcase your business to customers who are looking for your unique solutions and expertise to address their business needs.

Microsoft engages millions of customers every year through marketing, sales and service efforts. Most of these engagements create opportunities for us to provide referrals to our partners in the form of sales leads. 

As the first step to getting these leads, create a marketing profile. We'll show your profile to customers who are searching for partners who can help them implement Microsoft products and solutions, through:

*  **The [Find a partner](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/pcv/search) search experience**. Potential customers can search partner listings on their own to locate partners who meet their search criteria. 
*  **Referrals from Microsoft sales and service employees**. Potential customers interested in deploying cloud-based technology solutions contact Microsoft for help finding professionals who can meet their business needs. These Microsoft professionals can then refer potential customers to your company.

**Pinpoint 和 C2PC**：我们正在将这些工具合并到合作伙伴中心。 If you’ve used these tools in the past, create a new marketing profile in Partner Center to continue to generate and manage your sales leads. Note, we don’t currently support importing profiles from the previous sites. 

## <a name="create-a-profile"></a>Create a profile

Create profiles for each region you are authorized to do business in. 

1.  Log into [Partner Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=808956) using a [global admin or admin agent account](create-user-accounts-and-set-permissions.md).

2.  从**仪表板**菜单中选择**引荐** &gt; **查看营销配置文件** &gt; 选择一个国家/地区 > **[创建营销配置文件](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/pcv/publishing)**。

3.  在**创建营销配置文件**页面中，选择一个地区，然后输入你的配置文件信息。
    
    Note, while Partner Center supports multiple languages, some elements such as the description and free-form tags may need to include text from different languages, as noted in this topic.

### <a href="" id="partner_info"></a>Partner information

Introduce your company, adding a logo and a brief description, and a link to your website. 

The logo can be a GIF, JPG, or PNG file, with a maximum width of 300 pixels. We recommend using square or long aspect ratios. Tall aspect ratios are not recommended.

Your description can be up to 1000 characters. Tips for a great description: 

*  **Be brief**, leading with what’s important in the first sentence or two. This should be the headline that catches customers’ attention. In the Find a partner search experience, we show the first line or two in the search results preview.
*  **Focus on your company’s experiences with Microsoft-specific offerings**. Customers searching for referrals are generally looking for partners with Microsoft-specific experience.
*  **Use bullets**. Break up information into bulleted lists to make it easier to scan.
*  **Avoid jargon**. Use simple, everyday language, naming your offerings for what they do: the business needs they address, or task or objective they help customers accomplish.
*  **Don’t worry about filling the description with search keywords**. The customer search tools search for keywords generated in the Partner Expertise section, not the description.
*  **Keep your profile current**. With each software or service release, update your profile, keeping it in sync with your company's website.
*  **Do not refer to another Microsoft partner company by name**, unless it is a subsidiary or is otherwise affiliated with your company, or you have a current agreement with that partner company to act in partnership and/or promote each other for shared work opportunities.
*  **For regions with multiple languages**, consider including text from multiple languages in the description.

#### <a href="" id="linkedin"></a> LinkedIn company page: more ways to connect

### <a name="partner-expertise"></a>Partner expertise

“查找合作伙伴”搜索工具会查找专长标记。 优化这些标记，以让他人更容易发现配置文件。

Start by adding your own tags into the Partner Expertise section. Tags you can add: 

*  **Industry focus tags**. Up to 5 industries
*  **Products**. Limited to Microsoft products
*  **Service type** 
*  **Solutions, skills, and capabilities**. These tags are free-form, and provide you the ability to add search keywords that are unique to your capabilities.

Other tags used in search:
*  **Competency tags** are an earned designation showcasing your company’s capabilities.
*  **Endorsement tags** are earned when Microsoft or your customers who have worked with you endorse your work.

#### <a href="" id="#allow_us_to_endorse_areas_of_expertise"></a>Allow Microsoft to endorse my areas of expertise

建议选择此设置。 

当你通过合作伙伴中心证明成功吸引了客户，或者参与其他 Microsoft 认证或计划时，我们将针对为取得该成功做出贡献的你的特定产品、服务和行业自动添加认可。 认可是搜索结果中的重要因素。

如果你为某些产品提供了服务，但你不想在配置文件中显示它们，则可以取消选中此框并手动管理你的配置文件。 These endorsements will be hidden from your customers view, but you can add them back to your profile later at any time.

### <a name="customer-preferences"></a>Customer preferences

#### <a href="" id="#target_size"></a>Target size

You can opt out of referrals from businesses that don’t meet your target customer size.

By opting out, you’ll have more time to spend on businesses that are a match for the businesses that you prefer to work with.

### <a href="" id="#locations"></a> Locations

每个区域，最多可以添加 5 个贵组织的顶层位置。 These locations appear when customers search for partners by proximity. 

Indicate locations that are official company locations and can be validated. Pick locations that are central to the markets you serve, and best represent your company’s ability to fulfill.

完成位置信息的更新后，选择**保存此位置**或**保存此位置并添加其他位置**（即使仅添加一个位置）。

你添加的每个位置都会变成单独的配置文件页面。 更新配置文件页面时，请确保针对每个位置更新这些页面。

要更新位置的地址，首先需要**删除**此位置，然后重新添加它。

如果位于 5 个顶层位置，并且需要更改一个位置，则首先**删除**现有位置，然后添加新位置。

## <a name="review-your-profile"></a>查看你的配置文件

After you publish your profile, updates appear in the [Find a partner](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/pcv/search) searches within 24 hours. 

## <a name="improve-the-visibility-of-your-profile"></a>Improve the visibility of your profile 

*  **[Respond quickly to requests](responding-to-referrals.md)**. When you receive a customer referral, a faster response can lead to better results on the search pages for future customers.
*  **Be selective with your tags**.  It’s better to have fewer tags that best represent your company’s offers, solutions, value propositions, and unique position where you can consistently demonstrate success.  That will pay dividends in future search results.
*  **Earn competency tags** through Microsoft to demonstrate your proficiency in our products.
*  **Earn endorsement tags** from customers who appreciate your work.
