Microsoft Cloud Germany is designed to meet strict German data protection requirements and includes a German data trustee, operating under German law, who controls physical and logical access to customer data. All customer data, and the systems that process or control access to customer data, reside in German datacenters. The network between these datacenters is isolated and dedicated within Germany.

德国 Microsoft 云提供 [Microsoft Azure](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=847992)、Office 365 和 Microsoft Dynamics 的单独实例，它们从德国的数据中心提供。 As a result, commercial customers in the European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) can store and manage customer data in compliance with applicable German laws and regulations as well as key international standards. Microsoft personnel cannot access customer data without approval from and supervision by the German data trustee or customer.
