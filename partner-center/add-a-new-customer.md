Before you can sell subscriptions, manage billing, or provide support to a customer, you need to add them to your list of customers in Partner  Center.

>[!NOTE]
>For existing customers, including those who already have customer records in Partner Center through a [multi-channel](multichannel.md) or [Multipartner](multipartner.md) scenario, you can [Request a relationship with them](request-a-relationship-with-a-customer.md), instead of following the steps here.

### <a name="to-add-a-new-customer-in-partner-center"></a>To add a new customer in Partner Center

1. Select **Customers** from the Partner Center menu, and then select **Add customer**.

2. On the **Account info** page, enter the customer's details and primary contact information and verify that the customer has accepted and signed the latest [Microsoft Cloud Agreement](agreements.md).

>[!IMPORTANT] 
> On October 1st, 2019, Microsoft introduced the **Microsoft Customer Agreement** to the CSP program to replace the Microsoft Cloud Agreement. 为了方便合作伙伴迁移到新协议，在 2020 年 1 月 31 日之前，云解决方案提供商计划仍会支持当前的 Microsoft 云协议。 Read about the [Microsoft Customer Agreement and how to confirm consent](confirm-customer-consent.md)
  
3. If you're an indirect provider, select the indirect reseller you want to associate with this customer's subscriptions from the list.

4. Select **Next: Subscriptions** when you're finished entering all required information.

5. On the **Subscriptions** page, select the offer(s) your customer wants to buy from you, enter the number of licenses, and then select **Next: Review**.

6. On the **Review** page, check your entries for accuracy and then select **Submit** if the information is correct.

    >[!NOTE]
    >If you need to change any customer details, select **Update** in the **Account info** section. If you need to change the offers you selected, select **Update** in the **Subscriptions** section.

7. Select **Done** when you've finished adding the customer information and purchased the required subscriptions.
