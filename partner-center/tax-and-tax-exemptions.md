# <a name="taxes-and-tax-exemptions"></a>税和免税

适用范围：

- 合作伙伴中心
- Microsoft Cloud for US Government 合作伙伴中心

The Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program is a sales channel focused on partner resale of products. As a result, Microsoft is not always required to charge sales tax on partner invoices. The rules vary by country and/or region. You can review [country-specific and region-specific details for tax exemptions](#country-and-region-tax-details).

Partners should work with their tax advisor to [file tax exemptions](#file-tax-exemptions) based on their locations and where their customers are based.

## <a name="country-and-region-tax-details"></a>Country and region tax details

Specific tax-related information is available for the following countries and regions: [Canada](#canada), [the European Union](#european-union), [South Africa](#south-africa), [Turkey](#turkey), and [the United States](#united-states). For Taiwan and Korea, see [tax receipts details](#tax-receipts-and-daf).

If you're in another country or region that charges taxes, see [the information for other regions](#other-regions).

For additional questions, [request support in Partner Center](#support).

### <a name="canada"></a>加拿大

大多数经销商都不会免除 GST/HST/QST。 Consult your tax advisor to determine whether you are qualified for exemption, and what documentation you should provide to Microsoft.

For a BC PST Exemption, file a tax exemption as described. 提供 BC PST#，或填写完整并已签名的“一般免税证书”。

### <a name="european-union"></a>欧盟

在欧盟成员国中，合作伙伴必须提供有效 VAT ID 号码才能进行逆向征税并生成正确帐单。 The VAT number must be accepted as valid.

Microsoft does not support credit and re-bill. Before you sell any subscriptions, you must [register your VAT ID number](organization-tax-info.md) in Partner Center.

### <a name="south-africa"></a>南非

Microsoft now applies the standard VAT on digital content and services purchased by partners in South Africa. To exclude the VAT from your invoices and manage this yourself, you must update your partner billing profile by [sending Microsoft your VAT ID number](organization-tax-info.md).

### <a name="turkey"></a>土耳其

Microsoft now applies the standard VAT on digital content and services purchased by partners in Turkey. To exclude the VAT from your invoices and manage this yourself, you must update your partner billing profile by [sending Microsoft your VAT ID number](organization-tax-info.md).

### <a name="united-states"></a>美国

美国的所有经销商都需要在接受 Microsoft 经销商协议后 30 天内提供免增值税文档。 每个州都具有不同的转售免税证书。 请与税务顾问合作，确定与你的合法地址和注册州相关的内容。

This may include resale exemption certificates that work across multiple states such as the *Streamline Sales* and *Use Tax Agreement Certificate of Exemption* or the *MTC Uniform Sales & Use Tax Exemption Certificate*.

### <a name="other-regions"></a>其他区域

If you are in another country or region that charges taxes, [request support in Partner Center](#support) for your questions.

## <a name="tax-receipts-and-daf"></a>Tax receipts and DAF

税收收据（适用于台湾或韩国）或 DAF 通常在发票生成后需要两周的周转时间。
