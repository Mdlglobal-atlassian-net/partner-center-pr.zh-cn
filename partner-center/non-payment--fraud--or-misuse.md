适用范围：

- 合作伙伴中心
- Microsoft Cloud for US Government 合作伙伴中心

你对客户的欺诈性购买和/或客户对所购服务拒不付款的行为负有财务责任。 Therefore, *we strongly recommend that you put in place fraud prevention and detection risk mitigation controls*.

若要避免和/或应对欺诈活动或滥用问题，请务必了解潜在风险并制定可以降低风险的策略和做法。

## <a name="enforcement-of-microsoft-acceptable-use-policy"></a>Enforcement of Microsoft Acceptable Use Policy

If Microsoft detects partner or customer activity that we confirm or suspect violates the Acceptable Use Policy, we will take enforcement steps. The customer could be immediately suspended. You'll be notified of enforcement actions or updated on your requests by Microsoft.

## <a name="abuse-of-service-risks"></a>Abuse of service risks

**Abuse of service** risks means customers who use cloud services in violation of Microsoft's Acceptable Use Policy.

### <a name="examples-of-abuse-of-service"></a>Examples of abuse of service

Examples of these violations of Microsoft's acceptable use policy can include:

- 垃圾邮件
- 黑客攻击
- Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
- 比特币开采
- 恶意软件传播
- 转售盗版订阅

## <a name="theft-of-service-risks"></a>Theft of service risks

**Theft of service** risks means customers who have no intention of paying for consumed services. This theft may involve using stolen payment instruments, providing false billing information, and/or defaulting on outstanding balances.

### <a name="examples-of-service-theft"></a>Examples of service theft

Examples of these online transaction risks can include:

- Transactions that don't occur in person ("credit card not present" transactions)
- 虚假身份
- Services provisioned and used before initial payment is received
- Emerging markets and/or high-risk regions for online fraud
- Automate account creation and purchasing by bad actors

## <a name="managing-online-risk"></a>Managing online risk

You can use the following recommendations to help you develop policies and practices to reduce your exposure to online transaction risks in the lifecycle of your customer relationships.

### <a name="onboarding-new-customers"></a>Onboarding new customers

Suggestions for reducing online risks when onboarding new customers include:

- Establish personal relationships with customers when possible (for example, contacting customers by phone).
- Verify customers' credentials and background through better methods (such as using credit bureaus or business commercial report agencies).
- Use multi-factor authentication (such as SMS verification) during sign-up to minimize exposure to robotic account creationg and purchasing.
- Manage and track identities using services (such as digital identity services).
- Assess customer financial strength through rigorous credit card fraud detection systems.
- Establish a clear collections policy. Detail your collections process and when access to subscriptions will be impacted by non-payment. (You can disable access or [suspend a customer's subscriptions](suspend-a-subscription.md) for non-payment.)

### <a name="managing-customer-accounts"></a>Managing customer accounts

Suggestions for managing customer accounts post-purchase include:

- Implement a process to quickly receive, review, act on, and respond to Microsoft notifications.
- Work with customers to understand their cloud usage business needs while settings appropriate monitoring thresholds. (For example, you can [set a monthly Azure spending budget](set-an-azure-spending-budget-for-your-customers.md) in Partner Center. This allows you to monitor customer usage during the month and be notified when customers are close to their budget.)
- Monitor [customer activity logs](activity-logs.md) regularly to help detect fraud early.
- Take quick action when suspicious activities are detected.
- Avoid giving customers full administrative access to subscriptions without first implementing risk mitigation controls.

### <a name="managing-customer-billing"></a>Managing customer billing

Suggestions for managing customer billing post-purchase include:

- Request prepayments prior to initial transactions and billing .
- Don't accept high-risk payment instruments (such as pre-paid cards or stored-value cards).
- Monitor customer payments and aging accounts receivables. Aggressively enforce standardized dunning processes for late payments or non-payment.
