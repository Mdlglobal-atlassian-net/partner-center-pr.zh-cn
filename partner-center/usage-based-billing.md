When you buy online services such as Azure subscriptions, you’re billed for monthly usage rates. Usage-based services, such as Azure, are billed according to metered rates, based on consumption.

Some Microsoft products and services use a "pay as you go" billing model, in which you are billed only for services used. For example, Microsoft Azure uses this model. 

## <a name="usage-billing-frequency"></a>Usage billing frequency

Only **monthly billing** is available for usage-based products. For more information on monthly billing, see [Monthly and annual billing differences](billing-annual-monthly.md).

Usage-based subscriptions are billed monthly, in arrears, on the **subscription anniversary date**. For example, if the subscription anniversary date is the 15th, you will be charged on January 15th for the service period of December 15th to January 14th. You will be charged again on February 15th for the service period of January 15th to February 14th. 

## <a name="usage-charges"></a>使用情况费用

The charges that are generated on the subscription anniversary date will appear on the following invoice and [reconciliation file](usage-based-recon-files.md).

You may occasionally notice that some usage charges are missing from your invoice, or that usage from a previous month is charged in the current month’s invoice. This is not an error; it simply means that the service was timestamped after the services occurred. Usage reported within 24 hours of the end of the billing cycle will appear on the next month’s bill.

You can suspend usage-based subscriptions at any time.

Azure CSP 价目表每月发布一次，可以在合作伙伴中心的“销售”->“定价和产品/服务”页面上找到。 请注意，价格每天都可能会变动，并且会反映在价目表的“更改历史记录”选项卡上。

使用费按每日价格计算。 如果价格在服务期间内发生变化，你将看到每个按比例计算的服务期间和适用价格的计费行。
