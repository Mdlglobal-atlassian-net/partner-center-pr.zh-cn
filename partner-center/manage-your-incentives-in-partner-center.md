Now that Partner incentives management is available in Partner Center, you can sign up for incentives, access your tax and payment profiles, access your earnings and payment statements, and manage users – all here in Partner Center. 

Beginning with already enrolled Partners, we are enabling partners to manage incentives in Partner Center in phases starting in July. Look out for an email from us letting you know that it is time to set up your organization for incentives in Partner Center. 

Admins, if you have received the email, follow these three easy steps today:

1.  登录到合作伙伴中心 
2.  按照电子邮件中的说明进行操作，设置奖励用户 
3.  为你新设置的奖励用户提供合作伙伴中心登录凭据

When the Incentive Admin has received credentials, they can complete the migration of your organization which will enable your organization to manage your incentives here – in Partner center.
