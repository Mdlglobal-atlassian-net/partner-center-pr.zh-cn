# <a name="types-of-billing-in-partner-center"></a>Types of billing in Partner Center

适用范围：

- 合作伙伴中心
- 云解决方案提供商计划中的合作伙伴

You'll be billed for Partner Center purchases depending on the products, solutions and services you buy on behalf of your customers. The types of billing are as follows:

- [**License-based billing**](license-based-billing.md), where you're billed per license (not by license usage).
- [**Usage-based billing**](usage-based-billing.md), where you're billed for monthly usage rates.
- [**Billing for one-time and select recurring charges**](one-time-and-recurring-billing.md), where you pay in advance for a preset term for Microsoft and third-party ISV products.
- Billing for license-based SaaS transactions (see [**common billing scenarios for SaaS charges**](common-billing-scenarios-saas.md)).

根据为客户购买的具体产品类型，你可能会有不同的计费周期，并且我们可能会在同一月内的不同日期向你收费。

If you’ve chosen to be billed monthly or if you’ve bought usage-based products that are billed monthly, your monthly billing date is the day of the month you selected when you created your CSP account on Partner Center. After you’ve successfully created your CSP account, Microsoft will send a confirmation email that includes your billing date. Once created, this date cannot be changed.
