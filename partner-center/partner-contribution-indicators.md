# <a name="partner-contribution-indicators"></a>合作伙伴贡献指示器

Partner Contribution Indicators (PCI) provides a holistic measure of a partner’s impact in driving successful customer outcomes and therefore greater differentiation in the market when a partner attains and maintains the Cloud Business Applications competency. Partners receive credit for key measures of customer success, such as successful deployments and increasing usage, and are rewarded for continuing to invest in and scale out their technical capabilities.

## <a name="scoring"></a>评分

PCI provides a sophisticated, holistic view of a partner’s technical capabilities, their ability to drive customer success, and their sales performance. PCI measures your company’s prior-year performance across seven key indicators:

1. **Net new revenue** — Net new revenue across all sales channels for Microsoft Dynamics 365 products.
2. **Net customer adds** — Net customers acquired for Dynamics 365 across all sales channels.
3. **Functional consultants** — Number of individuals holding a currently active Functional Consultant Associate certification for Dynamics 365.
4. **Functional consultant growth** — Growth in the number of Functional Consultant Associates since March 31, 2020.
5. **Developers** — Number of individuals holding a currently active Developer Associate certification for Dynamics 365.
6. **New large deployments** — Number of production tenants that cross the high-usage threshold over the past 12 months.
7. **Monthly active user growth** — Growth in monthly active users across all your customers over the past 12 months.

Points are granted for each achieved indicator, resulting in a single-number PCI score. 100 maximum points are possible. PCI score determines competency eligibility:

Each indicator brings a score that is added to the total. Here are the maximum scores for each indicator:

### <a name="thresholds"></a>阈值

每个 PCI 指标都有 Microsoft 设置的阈值，达到此阈值你的公司就可以获得最高分数。 Customer Engagement 和 Finance & Operations 的这些阈值是不同的。 在发达市场运营的合作伙伴和完全在新兴市场运营的合作伙伴的阈值也是不同的。 如果合作伙伴有一个或多个客户在发达市场，则会应用发达市场阈值。 The developed or emerging market categorization of a country is based on the [Microsoft Partner Network definitions](https://assets.microsoft.com/MPN-developed-and-emerging-countries-list.pdf).

Points across each metric are tallied to yield a distinct PCI score for Customer Engagement and Finance & Operations which will be updated monthly.

合作伙伴如果达到或超出如下所示的阈值，则会获得给定指标的最高分。 可以获得除“功能顾问增长”之外的所有指标的部分分数，例如，发达市场合作伙伴如果净新收入为 150,000 美元，则会获得最高分数（10 分）的一半（150,000 美元/300,000 美元）。

## <a name="customer-to-partner-association"></a>客户与合作伙伴之间的关联

You receive credit for Net new revenue, Net customer adds, New large deployments, and Monthly active user growth for a given customer, within the bounds of the metric definition, only if you are the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), the Claiming Partner of Record (CPOR), or Digital Partner of Record (DPOR) for a paid subscription belonging to the customer's tenant.

A partner becomes the CPOR if they have established association with a customer at the subscription level via the Dynamics 365 [Online Solution Advisor](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4501560/online-services-advisor-osa-sell-incentives-faq) (OSA) incentive or Dynamics 365 [Online Services Usage](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3082044/become-eligible-for-the-online-services-usage-incentive-program) (OSU) incentive.

合作伙伴成为 DPOR 的前提是在产品的订阅级别建立了与客户的关联。

如果给定的订阅同时存在 CPOR 和 DPOR，则 CPOR 获得与订阅关联的 PCI 指标的所有信用额度。
