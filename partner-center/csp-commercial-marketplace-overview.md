Being a partner in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program allows you to bundle and sell Microsoft products along with solutions published by third-party, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs). Being able to bundle solutions in this way lets you better serve end customers and grow your CSP services business.

As a partner in the CSP program, you can use Partner Center to purchase many ISV solutions from Microsoft's commercial marketplace. This gives you and your customers several key advantages:

- Access to a catalog of software solutions optimized for Microsoft technologies and environments.
- Simplified contracting and shortened procurement cycle.
- A single integration with Partner Center APIs. (Such integration further enables access to a catalog of ISV solutions, lowers the cost of operations and engineering, and streamlines management of multiple vendor subscriptions and billing through a single provider.)
- Streamlined deployment and provisioning in the customer's Azure tenant (for Virtual Machine-based solutions).
- Reduces potential challenges with direct ISV purchase or contracting, Microsoft solution configuration and integration, and the need to manage or consolidate recurring invoices from multiple vendors.

If you are a partner in the CSP program, there are many commercial marketplace activities you may want to perform in regards to ISV offers. See the following table to learn more about each activity.

> [!NOTE]
> This overview describes how partners in the CSP program can use certain commercial marketplace features in Partner Center. In contrast to partners in the CSP program, ISV publishers have a different marketplace role. They also have different Commercial Marketplace features available to them within Partner Center. To learn more about the role of ISV publishers, see the [Azure Commercial Marketplace Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-overview).

## <a name="where-to-complete-commercial-marketplace-activities"></a>Where to complete commercial marketplace activities

As a partner in the CSP program, you can complete many commercial marketplace activities for ISV SaaS offers directly from either the Partner Center [dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) or by using [Partner Center APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/develop/). To complete other marketplace activities, however, you may need to go to:

- The [Microsoft Azure management portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

    或

- A third-party ISV publisher's system or website

Much of where you go to complete activities begins with the type of offer you choose. Partners in the CSP program can currently transact two types of offers with third-party ISV publishers:

1. License-based SaaS offers  
2. Usage-based offers (including offers based on virtual machines, containers or Azure applications)

Go to [Billing Basics](billing-basics.md) to learn more about how billing differs between license-based offers and usage-based offers.  

To learn where to complete a specific marketplace activity for license-based or usage-based ISV offers, see the following tables.

|**For license-based SaaS offers from ISVs**  |**用途**  |
